## This mod gives you the ability to change the visibility of item frames!

All you have to do is sneak and right-click an item frame with an empty hand.
In addition, you can hold an item frame in your hand to make invisible item frames that are nearby visible.
This mod is completely server-side, so you can easily use it on your own server.
